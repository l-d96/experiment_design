# Example Analysis of an A/B test
Example: first 500 visitors of a website are used in an A/B experiment. 250 are exposed to variation A, the rest to version B.

Question: which version causes people to view the most number of distinct pages? -> Distinct Pages Views is the metric.

## Design Consideration

What are our variables?

- Independent variables: the things we are manipulating. -> Site version
- Dependent variables: things that result from the manipulation (treatment). This is our measure -> distinct pages.

The idea behind an experiment is that some measure Y is the result of an effect X plus a measurement error:
```latex
Y ~ X + \epsilon
```

## Variable types
Variables have types. In [[test-of-proportions]] we had to re-encode the variables as `factors`, which is R speech
for categorical/nominal types.

There are numeric/continuos/scalar types, and ordinal types

- catgorical
- numerical
- ordinal (have an order)
