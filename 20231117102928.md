# Example Analysis of an A/B test
Example: first 500 visitors of a website are used in an A/B experiment. 250 are exposed to variation A, the rest to version B.

Question: which version causes people to view the most number of distinct pages? -> Distinct Pages Views is the metric.

## Design Consideration

What are our variables?

- Independent variables: the things we are manipulating. -> Site version
- Dependent variables: things that result from the manipulation (treatment). This is our measure -> distinct pages.

The idea behind an experiment is that some measure Y is the result of an effect X plus a measurement error:
```latex
Y ~ X + \epsilon
```

A measurement error is the random noise in the measurement we are taking. This is also the variation in things
that happen naturally.

This is why we need to have confidence in the sample size of our experiment.
